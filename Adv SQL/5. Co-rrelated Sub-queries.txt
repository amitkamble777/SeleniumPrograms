co-related sub-queries
----------------------
* it is a special type of subquery that works like both subquery and join.

* if we access an outer query column in the inner query then it is called as correlated subquery.

* Helps to fetch nth high / nth low value.


Eg:- Display first highest salary
---------------------------------
sql> 
  select * 
  from emp A 
  where 0 = (
		select count (distinct (b.sal)) 
		from emp b 
  		where A.sal < B.sal
	    );


  'n'th -> '(n-1)'th


Differences b/n subquery and correlated
---------------------------------------

SUBQUERY                                       CORRELATED

1)just works like a                        1)works like subquery and join.
 normal subquery.


2)In subquery outer depends                2)both are depended on each other.   
on inner but inner never depends on 
outer

3)outer query column is never accessed    3)outer query column is accessed inside 
inside a inner query.                 	    the inner query.


===========================================================
1.Display second least sal
SQL> select * from emp a where 1 =
     (select count(distinct(b.sal)) from emp b where a.sal>b.sal)
/


(

highest (max) 	<
least   (min) 	> 

)



2.display top 3 sal
SQL>  select * from emp a where 2 >=
     (select count(distinct(b.sal)) from emp b where a.sal>b.sal)
/

3.Display the employee who joined company first.
SQL>select * from emp a where 0 =
     (select count(distinct(b.hiredate)) from emp b where a.hiredate>b.hiredate)
/

4.display the 2nd highest comm
sql> select * from emp a where 1 =
     (select count(distinct(b.comm)) from emp b where a.comm>b.comm and a.comm is not null)
/

5.display the 1st record from table 
sql> select * from emp a where 0 = (select count (distinct(b.rowid)) from emp b where a.rowid>b.rowid); 
/


Eg:-
====

stid		totalmarks	with DIST	without DIST
============================================================		
101		599		1		1	
102		597		2		2
104		597		2		2
105		596		3		4
106		595		4		5

note
-----
* in case of a tie, "without distinct" would miss the next nth value / next rank where as 
  "with distinct" will not miss the next value.

* if you use with distinct you will get top 'n' salaries and if we don't use distinct then we get top 'n'earners.



EXISTS and NOT EXISTS :-
========================
- Both are boolean operators (Returns TRUE / FALSE)
- EXISTS will return TRUE if matching row is found, else it returns FALSE
- NOT EXISTS will return TRUE if matching row is not found, else it returns FALSE
- EXISTS is similar to IN and NOT EXISTS is similar to NOT IN
- EXISTS is faster than IN (becuase it uses semi-join) 
- NOT EXISTS is faster than NOT IN (because it uses anti-join)
- EXISTS & NOT EXISTS can be used in Co-related subquery.

- EXISTS works like Inner Join / Intersect which will give matching rows.
- NOT EXISTS works like MINUS which will give non-matching rows.



--Display all the depts that are having employees.
select *
from  dept
where deptno in (select deptno from emp);

Or
==

select *
from  dept A
where EXISTS (Select 1 from emp B where A.deptno=B.deptno);

--where EXISTS (Select 'x' from emp B where A.deptno=B.deptno);


===============================================================
--Display all the depts that are having no employees.
select *
from dept
where deptno not in (select deptno from emp);
--Returns FALSE if the inner query is having atleast one NULL.

Or
==

select *
from dept A
where NOT EXISTS (Select deptno from emp B where A.deptno=B.deptno);
--Returns TRUE even if the inner query is having NULLs.



Assignment
==========

2	y



orders
======
pid	ordid

1	1002


display the product which is not ordered? [Non-matching data]
	a) NOT IN
	b) NOT EXISTS
	c) MINUS
	
display the product which are ordered? [matching data]
	a) IN
	b) EXISTS
	c) INTERSECT
	d) INNER JOIN
	

Which is the best among them?
