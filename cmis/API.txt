Day 2 
Postman API testing tool 
We can do manual testing of APIS using postman 

Destktop/web 
Postman internally used your gmail accounts to access your postman features 
we can create postman accout by using gmail accounts---it is a prerequisit

After install postman -
we need to  create a free account.

What is the workspace in Postman
Workspace - initially we have  to start  one work space 

Workspace - are we  maintain files --eg. testcase , requesst, files and test cases everything saved in the workspace
every task is saved in the workspace 
Workspace is created in the google itself
Basically workspace is a area where we can save all the information-- testcase, test data all infromation about request 
Workspace created by postman by using gamil account

Create a new workspace /rename/ delete a worksoace

Workspace is the first priority of postman
Workspace is he basic level entity 
without workspae we can not do anything in the postman 

Create collection - -Create a colelction in postman 
Coolection - collection is nothing but the folder we can save all the test cases, request, and information about tesing in postmana

Inside 1 workspace we can create n number of collections 
Collection - contains number of  folders and http requests-- we can create differnt types of http requests in collection
create, rename , delete the collection , run the collection -  used for run all the test cases, multiple operation we can do under the collection 

Day 3 --Create own API

STEP 1.NodeJS
npm-node package manager

1st--  download the software 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
2.click on pribilt installer and select the windows
3.Unselect the checkbox from Tools for Native
and click on Next

Check the Nodejs path in environment variable --this is a confirmation of installation process 

After install software we have to exceute this 2  commands in command prompt
In Command prompt   2command we nedd to execute
1.node --version
2.npm --version

C:\WINDOWS\system32>node --version    for checking purpose which version is install
C:\WINDOWS\system32>npm --version  -- for checking the npm version is installed or not 
10.5.0

Step 2 .json-server
npm come along with the NodeJS

Run the below command in the CMD/Terminal 
npm install -g json-server 

This is not related to postman--just we to create our own API 

API need the backend data
save the json code in file 
We can give file name anything but extention should be json

We can create own API based on json file

E:\API json file>json-server name.json

After excute this command in command promt dont close the command promt --- if we close the command prompts  meaasn api running will stop 

we want to start api means-- again we need to run this command in command prompt
We need to minimize the command prompt

url display in command promot --means api is running 


After execute json file 
we can get  this 2 server

http://localhost:3000/0
http://localhost:3000/1

Day 4
Response Validations

Status
Headers 
Cookies
Response Time
Response Body

Assertions is called a validation points --- We have to add the assertions

pm--There is one library provided by PM(postman)

In pm library certain number of functions are available
This functions are written by using java script
postman intenally used java Scripts 


Write the one javascript  functions inside this function we need to call PM.functions
We will invoke this functions through which javascripts functions 

Two type of functions 
1.Normal function
2.Arrow Function


chai assertion library ---This is a kind of a java script framework

pm.test( "Test Name", function()
{
//asserion;
}
);
pm.tes("Test Name", ()=>
{
}

)
