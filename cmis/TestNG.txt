How to install TestNg
Help--> eclips market place -->Serch TestNG ---> click on go button ---> click on install
Accept the all trust Then restart the eclips  
Go to windows--> Prefernce --> and observe testng should be visible 

How to add testng jar file
Install testng through market place 
then download the testng jar from maven repository 
Add the downloaded jar in respective folder
-----------------------------------
TestNG- 
Purpose - design a test cases in systematic way 
testng it is a open source - it is available in jar file 
it is also called as java unit test frame work - testng and junit both are  used only for java 
Testng test which contain multiple test methods 

Advanage 
it will generate good html reports 
it gives dirrent annotations 

1.Test case & test suites
2.Grouping of test cases
3.Parameterization
4.Parrel Testing
5.Reports

No need the main method in testng to execute the testcase because testng will automatically execute the class
TestNG never work with main method 

every annotation should be associated with methods 
Testng execute the test methods based on alphabetical order
Based on the priority test method should be  executed
After given priority order of methods  will not be consider.
Priority no. no need to sequential and ano need to consecute , any random no we can give  testcase execute from lower no of priority
Priorities can be a random numbers (no need to have a consecutive number)
Default priority of test cases it will consider as a 0.
Priority same for multiple methods ---> Then it will consider as  alphabetical order
Test case execute from lowest priority order-- (Order , -1, -2) ---execute 1st - 2 priority
TestNg execute the test methods only if they are havig @Test annotation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Same driver not able to access in 2 test 
driver.

Beacause we created driver as a local objects of open the app method
Local means- whithin the method we will create 

Not possible to access this driver i noutside the methods 

We need to create the driver at class  level the it will access to all methods in that class

driver is a instance variable  and  it is a common variable accross all the methods 
Only one time we can create a variable WebDriver  driver;  --> In class level

Execute testcases using xml files
Throughout the testng xml file plays a very very immportant role
After click on convert to Testng --> it will generate the testng code at project level.

xml file automatically generate or We can create new  xml file also

We can create a new Xml file also --> custom xml file

xml file is also called as a suit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TestNG Annotation 
Annotations are placed over the method with @ symbol
Annootation is used to control the execution of  sequence and priority of method which allows to execute java code before and after a certain point 

Before method execute multiple time of before start the test/ method  
AfterMethod execute multiple time of After completion of Test /After completion of every test method 

@BeforeMethod- This will execute before the every test method 
@AfterMethod- This will execute After  execution of the every test method

Between this two class all the test methods are executed


@BeforeClass---This method will execute befor execution of the class /Before execution of all test methods  ---This method will execute only one time
@AfterClass---This method will execute after completion of class  After execution of all test methods --This method will execute only one time


@BeforeTest /@AfterTest

Before test and after we can run this testcase through xml file

User can run those testcase through xml file 

How to conver the xml test file 
select two class right click---> Click on Testng --->click on convert to TestNG---> then testng xml report will be  generated 
After create testng xml file -- We have refresh the project 


Herarchi of testng xml 
Suite --> Suite contains a multiple test 
Test-- every test contains a multiple clasees 
Classes ---Every class contains a class
Class-- every class contains a methods   

How to create a test tag in testng xml report
Test Method
 <test  name="Annotaton">
     <classes>
     <class name="TestNG_Programs.Annotation">
    <methods>
<include name= "Annotation"/>
 <include name= "test2"/>
	</methods>
	</class>

    <class name="TestNG_Programs.BeforeAfterTest" >
   <methods>
  <include name= "test1"/>
 <include name= "Beforeclass"/>
 </methods>
 </class>
 </classes>
 </test> <!-- Test -->
  
Before test and  after test will be executed multiple  time  

Before test-  this will execute  before starting the all classes
Afer class -- This will execute After completion of all the clasees 
@Before test / @after Test-- test we can create any one class - it is applicable to  all selected classes in tesng xml

@Before suite / @After suite --- We can create any oneclass it is applicable to all classes selected in TestNG xml file 

@Before suite ---It will execute befre starting the  test --- only one time 
@After suite --It will execute after completion of test - only one time 

Test and suite --purpose we have to execute testng xml file
For test & suite  annotaion we have to run the Xml file  

This all annotations is use to control your text execution
----------------------------------------------------------------
TestNG  Assertions 

1.login   ---> Entry position--> Repeate multiple times --> repeate before starting every test method
2..Search ---> @Test
3.Logout--->Exit poit---> @AfterMethod ---> it will Execute After method. 
4.login
5.Adv Search---> @Test
6.Logout ------> logout also repeate Multiple times

Apply the validation only on Search and adv ---> Test methods

xml file we can add sible or multiple  test cases

test case present between <test> tag name </test>

If we have to add 3 testcases in xml file 
we can add 3 classname in 3 test TagName.
Before testmethod and AfterTest Method we execute only one times, before execute test and after execute test
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assertion--> Assertion is the validation point in Testng

2 kinds of assertion in TestNg
1.Hard Assertion ---> Most of the time we will use Hard assertion
We can access from "Assert" class
Methods are static
If hard assertion failed then rest of the statement will not executed 

Hard assertion is  the last statement in the test method 
even it will fail it will exit that will not impact on anything
All assertion we put only in the test methods

2.Soft Assertion
We can access through "SoftAssert" objects

SoftAssert sa =new  SoftAssert(); 
sa.assertEquals(1, 3); 

If soft Assertion got failed then rest of the statement still execute
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TestNG Listeners

Based upon execution tsst Method  i need to perform some actions-- this actions are called post actions 
Test method pass--> post actions --> update the result in reports 
Test faile--> Post method --> Capture the screenshot of the page and i can update the status is faile in the reports alonng  with screenshot
That we can do only after exectution is done 
Tset mehod skip---> n ow i update the skipping status in the reports 
Based upon execution actions we can perform the certain actions --Post actions we can do using TestNg listners 
Listner class we have to create for perfoms df actions
inside listner class dosent have a any method and any class

Itest listners is a interface in the testng 
In this interface certain methods are  available for performning actions 

Test pass--> on test pass method will automatically trigger
we are not going to wirte a new method 

Listner is nothing but a class which contains a method which are implemented from Mytest listner interface---
passs, fail, skip---> should not change this method - it will automatically trigger.

All methodsd are defaults in the Listner interface
-----------------------------
Step
1. Create Test case
2.Create Listner class
3.Create xml file and include both test case & listner class.

2 ways to implement listner class
-------------------------------------
Claas myListner implements ITListners
{
}
Claas myListner exends TestListnersAdapert---> this is also predefined class

How we can implement testng listners -->By using any of his option we can implemen Listners class

Listner class 
While implementing every method should be publish.

This method i get it from ITListners
public class ListernAction implements ITestListener
{

public void onTestStart(ITestResult result) {
   // not implemented
  }

public void onTestSuccess(ITestResult result) 
{
    // not implemented
  }
public void onTestFailure(ITestResult result) {
    // not implemented
  }

Onstart--->it will execute  only one time before sart all methods  
OnFinish--->It will execute only one time after execute all test methods 
OnTestStar--> It will execute before  start every test case
Test --> meaning of testmethod which is there inside the class

xml file test is totally different
----------------------------------
3rd step --cretae the xml file 
Which approach listener class is prefer or why 

Why we should not go with the annotations
xml file --> we haev to execute multiple test cases suit only one time through xml file thats 
put the listener class only one place in xml file that is applcable for all the test cases


Listner class---> For every class i have to enter the listeners annotation

Why only one listner class maintain --->because post actions should be same  for all kinds of test classes and test methods

Report generation is the main post actions 
all 100 test cases result should be populated in only one report 

For all the test cases we have only one listner class for all the test cases 
Purpose of listner class --> post actions and updatee the result as per the condition in the reports 

How to generate the extent report---> This is a custom report
Repoert  generation is a post actions ---> After execution all the test case  we will create a report 
Before execution of test case we cannot create a report
Multiple listeners---> Unnecesary --> it will create a multiple report--> ultimately we will create anly one report
Unnecesary it  will getting the duplicate results
----------------------------------------
How to generate the extent report---> This is a custom report--usin listeners class

For this we need to add the Extentreport dependany

Extent reports we can used everywhwer - testng , BDD framework
3 classses are provided
1.ExtentSparkReporter  ----> it is responsible for UI of the report---> how its look likes--> deals with UI of the Repoerts

2.ExtentReports--->This class responsible for populating some common information in the report
eg. operating system name, browser, project, windows, version ,tester name, environment --> this are the common information

3.ExtentTest--> This class responsible for updating the status in the report-- result- pass, fail skipp, amd attaching the screenshot 

Go to project level and create the folder to generate the reports
In that report folder we can create all the report--
-----------------------------------------------------------
ExtentSparkReport--- we have  to pass the titleor report, name of report and theamof the report

ExtentReport ---> details will automatically populate the information in the report
--------------------------------------------------------------
TestNG XML File 
Testng xml file
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="All Test Case">
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test">
    <classes>
      <class name="TestNG_Programs.TestCase1"/>
      <class name="TestNG_Programs.TestCase2"/>
      <class name="TestNG_Programs.Test3"/>
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test -->
</suite> <!-- All Test Case -->

Testng Test case

How to  run test case from xml file ?
Through xml file user can run a  multiple test cases
create number of test case suite and we can execute parallel
some times pass the paramaeter from xml file to your test cases

once we create xml files we need to add all clases in that xml files 
User can able to add multiple testcase in testng xml report 
Based on the priority method will be execute  

aasert.fails--- this command is used to fail the method/test
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Suite-->Test Cases-->Test Step
-------------
3 Step ---open the browser and application 
1.Setup 
2.Login
3.Close the browser.
