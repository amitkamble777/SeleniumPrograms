First database and table in Mysql
Create database  collage--- this is a database  name 

create table Collage.student   - student it is a table name this table - before create table without using  database  thats why i used collage. student
(
studid int,
name varchar(20),
city varchar(200)
)




SQL tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix,  Postgres, and other database systems.

Create table and insert the data

create table customer( customer_name  varchar,(20),  age int , city varchar(20), salary int )


Insert into 
1)  insert into customer (customer_name, age, city , salary )
         Values ("amit",25,"mumbai", 5000)

 2)  Insert into emp
       Values ( 108 ,"rahul", "sydney",25)

Distinct statement 
It is used to return different (distinct) record 
distinct operand : should contain only 1 column 

select  distinct emp_age from emp.


WHERE CLAUSE
WHERE clause  is used to filter the record.
Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
 

Select * from  emp
where   empp_name = "priya"

Use 3 column/ condition in where clause 
select   empp_name, emp_age , city  from emp
where   empp_name  = "priya"  or emp_age= 24 or city="goa"

Operators in Where clause 
Operator	Description	Example
=	Equal	
>	Greater than	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal	
<=	Less than or equal	
<>	Not  equal . Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as != 

	
BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
LIKE	Search for a pattern	
IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column

Select   empp_name, emp_age ,  city  from emp
where   emp_age between 28 And 45

select * from emp
where  empp_name  like '%t'  :- %t represents names last character is t	

Where clause can be combined with AND, OR, NOT operator.

AND  and OR operator are used to filter the record based on more than one condition.
AND : All condition are separated by AND are true
OR: If any of the condition are separated by OR is true
NOT: If condition is not true.

NOT Condition :  seen all record in table except priya 
Select * from emp
Where not empp_name= " priya "

select  * from emp
where empp_name= "priya" AND  (city = "nanded" OR emp_age=30)

ORDER BY keyword
Is used to sort the sort the result set by ascending and descending order

ORDER BY keyword  :- sorts the records in ascending order by default
select *  from emp
order  by emp_age desc

Update table
Is used to modify the existing record in the table
At a time 2 condition update
update emp
set emp_age = 32, empp_name= "pooja"
where  emp_id =107

update emp
set emp_age = 30,
where empp_name= "amit"   We have an error in sql syntax : - check the manual that correspond

At a time update 2 columns and 3 rows
UPDATE EMP
SET EMPP_NAME='rani', CITY='goa'
WHERE EMP_ID IN (104,105,101)

Update at a time 2 to 3 column 
UPDATE EMP
SET EMPP_NAME='rani', CITY='goa'
WHERE EMP_ID IN (104)

Error code 1175  : You are using safe update mode 
Solution  :-set sql_safe_updates=0;

DELETE Statement 
Is used to delete  the existing record in the table.

Null value  statement  :- Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.
A field with null value is a field with no value.
null value is a different form of zero values of fields that contains spaces

Select  emp_age from company 
Where emp_age is null

It is not possible to test for null values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

IS NOT NULL
 
The IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (NOT NULL values).
select emp_age from company 
where emp_age is not null

Add column in table 
alter table emp---table name
add column salary  int  ---- column name 

Change column name
alter table emp
change column salary  salary int 

SQL Joins
Combine rows from two or more tables, based on related column between them.
select a.empp_name, a.city, a.emp_age, a.salary,b.emp_age, b.bonus from emp a inner join company b
on  a.salary  = b.salary 

select a.empp_name, a.city, a.emp_age, a.salary,b.emp_age, b.bonus, b.salary, b.company_id from emp a inner join company b
on a.salary = b.salary 

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

alter table emp
change column salary salary int 

Join three tables
select   a.empp_name,  a.city, a.emp_age, a.salary,b.emp_age, b.bonus, b.salary, c.city, c.age, c.customer_name 
from ((emp a inner join company b
on a.emp_id = b.company_id)
inner join customer c
on a.emp_id=c.customer_id);

left join
select a. Empp_name, a. city, a.emp_age, a.salary,b.emp_age, b.bonus, b.salary  
from emp a left join company b
on a.emp_id = b.company_id 
order by a.emp_age;

The SQL SELECT INTO Statement
The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table.


SQL IFNULL(), ISNULL(), COALESCE(), and NVL() Functions

Solutions
MySQL

The MySQL IFNULL () function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL:

Select customer_name, city*(salary + age)
from  customer

Right join :- return all records from rigt table T1, and matching records from left table T2. The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match. 
select a.empp_name, a.city, a.emp_age, a.salary,b.emp_age, b.bonus, b.salary  
from emp a right join company b
on a.emp_id = b.company_id 
order by b.bonus;


Full / Outer join:-
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same



Union operator
union operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more select statement.
1. Every select statement within union must have the same number columns
2. Columns must also have similar data types
3. The colummns in every select statement must also be in the same order 

1 column
  select city from emp
  union
  select city from customer
  order by city      --------> order by is used to sequence of leter/ alphabetical order

Multiple Column

select emp_age, salary, city from emp
union 
select age, salary, city from customer


Union all
To allow duplicate values 

Multiple column at a time 
select emp_id emp_age, salary, city from emp
union all
select customer_id age, salary, city from customer

Note:-The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.

Sql Union with where
select city, empp_name from emp
where empp_name='pooja'
union
select city, customer_name from customer
where customer_name='sumit'
order by city 

Sql Group by statement
groups rows that have the same values into summary rows 
Group by function is often used with the aggregate function(min(), max(), sum(), count(), avg()) to group the result set by one or more columns


select count(emp_age), city from emp
group by city

select count(emp_age), city from emp
group by city
order by count(emp_age) desc

select avg  (salary), city from emp
group by city

Group by with join sql example
select a.empp_name, count(b.customer_id) as numberofcity from customer b left join emp a
on a.emp_id=b.customer_id
group by empp_name

Sql Having clause 
Having clause was added to sql because WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions
select count(emp_id) , empp_name from emp
group by empp_name
having count(emp_id) >=2
order by count(emp_id)


SQL exist operator
EXISTS operator is used to test for the   existence of any records in a sub query
EXISTS operator return true if sub query returns one or more records 
select  a.empp_name, a.emp_id, a.emp_age, a.city from emp a
where exists (select salary from customer b where a.emp_id = b.customer_id) and salary >19000

SQL ANY AND ALL OPERATOR
ANY and ALL operator allow you to perform a comparison between single column value and range of other values 

ANY operator
1.Return a Boolean value as a result
2.return True if any of the sub query values meet the condition 

ANY:- means condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the value in the range 

Select customer_name from customer 
where  city=any
(select city from emp 
where emp_age <32)

The ALL operator:

select all emp_age, empp_name from emp
Where true

returns a Boolean value as a result
returns TRUE if ALL of the sub query values meet the condition
is used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statements
ALL:- means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range. 

Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).
