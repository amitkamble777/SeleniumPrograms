How to launch the browser in selenium webdriver in selenium
1. Search the selenium
2. click on https://www.selenium.dev/
3. click on down load and then click on Browsers
4. On firefox browser click on (documentation) hyperlink
5. click on geckodriver releases, (Link)
6. click on 0.33.0 to download
7.click on (geckodriver-v0.33.0-win64.zip) link 
8. extract the file on particular location 
9.copy the driver exe and paste in resource folder in selenium package 
10. right click on driver exe file --> click onproperties --> check the  location 
11. copy that location and add in system.setProperty  

Same process for all driver 

after adding cromedriver and geckodriver in selenium resurce folder geeting path error 
illegalStaeException 

create one common folder and centralize folder and we can place all the executable files in that folder  
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.ElementNotInteractableException: element not interactable
  (Session info: chrome=116.0.5845.140)
  After given correct xpath and locator but exception will come ?
Ans-  
--------------------------------------------
Webelements
inputbox/textbox, button, link, radio buttons, check boxes, dropdown, listbox, combobox,
frame webtable,calendar,file upload, drag and drop 
------------Dropdown------------------------------------------------- 
Inside dropdown every option is a web element 
we can select the option from dropdown in 3 different ways/methods 

1st steps get the elemment from drop down 
2. pass the webelement in select class constructor

All options are in the form of web elements

we can access those methods by using -- select class  option 
Select class is a special class to handle dropdown
---- this 3 method we can select the options from dropdown
selectByVisibleText("india"); -f- pass the text values present on the web page 
selectByValue("1"); //india -- it is a actual value --- 
            //we take the attribute  we need pass value of the value attribute (<option value="1" > india </option>)
selectByindex("0")//india ;----- index will start from (0)

How to Handle multiple drop down using generic method
we should write the multiple select class for multiple drop down field 
Just calling the userdefined method multiple times whenever we want to select the option from dropdown 

BootStrap drop down 
TAG is differenet it is not a select  tag 
< li 
 <a
   <labe1 --- is reperesenting the tex of the option
     < input--- input is reperesnting the checkbox of the option
This drop down totally dependss on xpath	

We need to write  the common xpath

Hidden drop down ---> This is also called as dynamic drop down--- this option is loaded only on runtime
On HTML 
<div tagname  is showing ---> WebElement is not visible in HTML 
How  to slect this options 
   
---Dynamic drop down ---> This options are  dynamically comming otherwise it is a autosuggestion box 
Thia options are suggested Here
1st step --How  to visible the option on HTML Page 


By using selector ub we can handle this type of drop down , even auto suggestive drop down/Hidden drop down 
SelectorHub 1 feature --> trun on debugger by using this option we can make options visible on HTML Page
The time of debuuger  is only 5 secords after on debugger immediatly click on drop down element

1. Screen shot script 
File f=((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
Files.copy(f, new File("C:\\Users\\JYOTHSNA\\Pictures\\Picture\\selenium.jpg "));

1. Captur the screen shot of full page 
which contains a method called TakesScreenshotAs Method 
webdriver interface its a root interface ---- contains a lot of methods which are implemented by multiple classes 

Remotewebdriver is a class is implemented method from javascript executor and TakesScreenshot --this 2 is also other types 
of interfaces 

takesScreenShot variable can not hold a webdriver interface 

TakesScreenshot ts= (TakesScreenshot)driver;
(TakesScreenshot) -- it is type casting 

2. Captur the screen shot of section of page
inspect the page take a xpath for selected section
give the webelement and create variable section
 WebElement section=driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@id='content']"));
File src=section.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
File trg=new  File(".\\Screenshot\\Phones and PDAs.png");   // Location of file to save the screen shot 
Files.copy(src, trg);

3. Captur the screen shot of element on a page
 WebElement logo=driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//div[@class='Home-cards-list'])[3]"));
        File Sourcelogo= logo.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
        File targetf= new File(System.getProperty("user.dir")+"\\ScreenShot\\HomeConfig.png");
        Sourcelogo.renameTo(targetf);  


For example we haev 10 test cases some of the test casess is fail that time we need to take screen shot

Put one condition --> only on fail test cases we need to take a scren shot
After ecxecution of test capture the information
If the testcase is fails capture the Screen shot 
If the Test case are  pass provide the details in the reports 

This types of conditions we verify using TestNG Listners

What is the use of ChromeOptions, EdgeOptins, FirefoxOptions class

What is the purpose of using of Option Classes

How to use ChromeOption Class and what are the thing to achive through ChromeOption Class

Chrome setting we can  cotrol using ChromeOption Class 
We cancontrol browser settings method through ChromeOptions Class.
------------------------------------------------
1.Headless Testing 
I will run my testcase but this test case will run in backend
We are unable to see the any action on webpage , finding the element, click on the button enter the text in the field
Withoout seeing any UI and any Actions we can execute  the  test case-- an dwe will get only final output


ChromeOptions options= new ChromeOptions();
	options.addArguments("--headless=new--"); // this is a setting for Headless mode of Execution
	WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver(options);

options.addArguments("--Headless=new--");--> this is a fixed parameter  provided by selenium documentation.

By using this Case we can achiview  Headless testing 

Advantages
1.We can do multiple task--While exectuing testcase in backend we can do anything open notepad that will not distrub the execution test caseas
2. Faster Execution --> Execution is very faster -- no need of  any UI  because testcase will execute in backend.
Execution and perfomace wise Headless testing is very faster
Headless testing is more faster that Header testing.

If we do any activity parallely it will disturb our execution in Header mode
In header mode until execute test case we cnnot do anything. Meanwhile we can not do anything.

Disadvantages
1.User can not see any actions on the page. So user can not understand the flow/functionality of test.
At the time of begining level wewill prefer the Header testing , because  user should knows the UI and actions on the Page
if our testeces are already executed many times and many testcases are pass lot of times
execution should be faster , because we executed/ Pass testcase many times already 
We need execution is very fast that time we can use headles mode
Jenkins is a tools by default it will execute the test case in headless mode -- they no need  UI

Once done framework, execution of testcase in automatiom and everything in automation --> After we can prefer headless mode




2) SSL Handling-  Secure Socket layer
SSL Exception, By default can not handle the automation.

ChromeOptions option= new ChromeOptions();
	option.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true);
    WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver(option);
It is very difficult to find out this type of Pages

SSL- Means -user unable to open the Website ---> warning message is showing Your connection is not private

same methods are avialble in every class  chrome, firefox, edge


3) Chrome is being controlled by Automated test software.
I want to remove this message while launching my browser --That also we can set ChromeOption class

To Remove "Chrome is eing controlled by Automated test software."
ChromeOptions option= new ChromeOptions();
	option.setExperimentalOption("excludeSwitches" , new String[] {"enable-automation"});
    WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver(option); 
   driver.get("https://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts");
   
   
4) TO run the tests in Incognito mode	
   ChromeOptions option= new ChromeOptions();
   option.addArguments("--incognito");
    WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver(option);
driver.get("https://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts");
driver


5)Enable extentions in browser  -  video session 38 --> time 1:35 to check this scenarios 
----------------------------------------------
After enable the addblocker extention -- -Make our page is add fix 
	
How to enable the extention at runtime 
After enable exention we will block the add

Those extentions will be diabsle automatically while we run the Test Case
We can apply this process any type of extentions

4 steps

Step 1 - Add CRX Exractor/Download to chrome browser  (manually)
Step 2 -Add selectorH plugin to chrome browser (manually)
Step 3 -capture crx file for selectorshub extention
Step 4- pass crx file path in automation script in chrome option.

How to handle multiple windows  windows
		
1. How to handle browser windows in selenium
How can get the id of browsers 
every time dynamically window id will be change multiple time
every time we will get a different windowo ID

Every window has id this is called as window handles
All windoe ids will be in the string format 
This id is require to switch between one browser to another browser
------------------------------------------------------------
How  to capture parent as well as child window ids 
this window IDs require to switch between one browser window to another browser window 
driver is still focussing on the parent window 
by using window id we can switch to another browser---then we can intercat the web element present in the chlid windows 

2. How to Switch between Multiple Browser Windows ?	
this window IDs require to switch between one browser window to another browser window 
driver is still focussing on the parent window 
by using window id we can switch to another browser---then we can intercat the web element present in the chlid windows

1st Launch the browser --- it is parent windowo
2nd click on link ---- Open the 2nd browser -- it is a child window 
--------------------------
1st capture the window id
2nd we are extracting parent windowid and child windowid
3rd using switching command

//By using For each loop --we can execute in one shot	

3. How to close All browser Windows ?
driver.close();  // close only one browser-- close the child browser
driver.quit(); // close both parent and child browser

4. How to close Specific Browser Window by choice ?
for(String winid:windowIDsList)
{
	String title=driver.switchTo().window(winid).getTitle();
	if(title.equals("OrangeHRM"));
	{
	driver.close();	
	}
--> close the multiple specific browser<----- 
String title=driver.switchTo().window(winid).getTitle();
	if(title.equals("OrangeHRM")||title.equals("another title")||title.equals("another title")); // by using ||(OR) comand 
	{
	driver.close();
	}
	
	Handle multiple browser by using Arraylist
driver.findElement(By.linkText("PRACTICE")).click(); 
ArrayList<String> tabs = new ArrayList<String> (driver.getWindowHandles()); // Primary window
driver.switchTo().window(tabs.get(0));

ArrayList<String> tabs2 = new ArrayList<String> (driver.getWindowHandles()); //Secondary window
driver.switchTo().window(tabs2.get(1));

How to automate Link on Web page 

driver.findElement(By.linkText("")).click(); //-- Pass the complete value of the link
this will navigate to the another page -- After click action open the new window
	
driver.findElement(By.partialLinkText(" ")).click(); // 
No need to pass the complete value - pass we can just pass some portion of the values 
Anything frrom this actal srings

How to capture al the links  on the web page 
 List<WebElement> links= driver.findElements(By.tagName("a")); //Tagname a - store all the links on  webElement
 // all link will be same tagName store the links in this element as a variable 
// this particular method returns all the links as the webelement 

System.out.println("Number of links present:" +links.size()); // print all the links in console window

1.How to find how many links on the web page 
List<WebElement> links= driver.findElements(By.tagName("a")); 
// all link will be same tagName store the links in this element as a variable 
// this particular method returns all the links as the webelement 
System.out.println("Number of links present:" +links.size()); // print all the links in console window
	
//Normal for loop  to read all the links from the variable 
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
for(int i=0; i<=links.size(); i++)
{
	System.out.println(links.get(i).getText());             // get the name of link 
	System.out.println(links.get(i).getAttribute("herf"));   // get the actual target page of links --hyperlinks
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
//for each loop
for(WebElement link:links)
{
   System.out.println(link.getText());	// this is for link name
  System.out.println(link.getAttribute("href"));  // this is for actual link present on the web page 
}

2. Broken links means --  which dosen't have any target page		
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
windows + Left  and windows + Right 

----Locators   ---	
Locator is used to identify the element and  action on the element

selenium is a web driver will identify the element by using locator

1. identification 
2. Action 

Locators are addresses that identify element uniquely within the web Page.	

Locators ---
Different locators suppoetred on web element 
driver.findelement is a method which will use to find the elements on web page 

radio button, dropdown , everything available on the web page it is a web element which will retun a web element 

sendkey is a method it used to pass the some dta

WebElement search=driver.findElement(By.name("search"));
search.sendKeys("mobiles");
	
we can store the element in a variable thats why we use this  statement 
after use variable then to pass the values by using send key methods 

variable type always should be web element because everythin on the webelemet on the web page 


Class and TagName is not a unique
After user TagName locator--it will match the mutile element on the web page
some of the times --this two locators is used to find the more than the more than elements

sometimes tage name is also used for multiple elements
Claas 
sometimes class values is same for the multiple elements 

<li -- li tag name is just a list of items 
<li tag contains the <a tag contains the <img tage


Expand the<li tag inside  the <a tag 
Expand the <a tag inside the 
Expand the <img tage here exact image is  available 

How to count all list items on web page 

class attribute and values both are same more than multiple time

driver.findElements is a method it is used to find the more than one element on the web page 

After using class tagname not performing any actions
size()-- this method find out how many element on web page

This statement is used to find the no. of element on web page 
 
 int sliders= driver.findElements(By.className("swiper-slide text-center")).size();
 System.out.println(sliders);
 store the values in slliders variable
 
 <a tag is always associated with a link on web page 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customized Locators--- CSS & Xpath
CSS selector -- cascading style sheet language
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS Selectores -- Multiple combinations
Tag and ID 
# reperesent the ID in CSS
Tag and ID divided by using #
in this combiantion tag name is not mandetorily required 
we can  use directly only id attribute value #email
no need to use input#email -- tagname--  only attribute value is enough 

<input, id="email" >
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input#vaues of id"))  - inputtext is a values of id 
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input#email"))
Both will identify the element of tag and id combination 

input#email  ---> No need to pass the attribute in CSS Selector
TagName is a optional its not a mandetory 


Tag and Class -- is always seperate with .
. Represent the class in CSS
<input, class="inputtext" >
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input.inputtext"))
without using tagname direclty use like this
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".inputtext")) 

tag is a optional its not a mandetorily

input.hs-input

Tag and Attribute 
Her we can use any attribute 
<input, name="username">
name -- Is a attribute 
"username" -- is a values 
attributes -- it is a jeneric term-- we can use any attribute present on the web page 
Tag and attribute this is a more flexible 

driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input[name=username]")).sendkeys("amit.k");

driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("[name=username]")).sendkeys("amit.k");

TagName is an option-we can directcly specify the attribute in sqare bracket.
use any attribute of this combination 

4.Tag, class, Attribute 4 th coombination of css selector
some of the times tag and class both are same for the multiple elements on web page 
to differentiate those two element we can use another attributes  

In this scenario attribute is used to differentiate the element because tag and  class attribute values are same 

Whenever we want to put attribute always keep the square bracke [] 
Click on ctr+f open the search screen on html page to specify the css selector and Xpath
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Xpath --Absolute and Relative 
HTML Page 
right click -- click on View Source 
ON HTML Page -- it is very critical to find the element 
thats  why inspect the web Page 
Insteed of Html Page  right click and inspect 
it is very easy to find the element 

HTML will give the structure of the Page 

< a 
a is a anchor tag name 
< tex > -- It called as a inner text
For LOGO
<img  --- is a tag name
Every attribute will associate the some  values 

Every Link on web Page its having a anchor tag

sometimes dont have a any attributes only tagname 
After click on F12 page  navigate to the html code 

driver is a webdriver
FindElement is a method it is used to find the element on web Page 
.click() is a action element


Partial linklist -- No need to pass the complete text values 
---Just pass the partial values 
Link Text -- It is Case Sensitive values 
Pass the proper valus on linkList Locator 

ClassName and Tagname is used to open the  mutiple element on the web page
If user will use tagname locator --it will match with the multiple element on web Page 

Sometimes class values is same for the multiple elements on web page

After used this 2 locatore( ClassName and TagName) -- Most of the time user use  this locators it is used to find out the multiple link, elements on Web Page

Class is an common attribute  to find all the list of sliders
By using class attribute user cature all the element on web Page

Size() method is used to find the how many element on web 

CSS Selectores -- Multiple combinations

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Xpath locators 

User locate any kind of element by using xpath

some times after using name, id, link test or other locators unable to locate the element on web page , by using xpath we can defntly locate the element 

What is xapth ?
xpath is defined as a XML path
it is a syntax or language  for finding the any element on the web page using XML path expression 
Xpath is used to find the location of any element on web page using XML DOM structure. 
xpath can be used to navigate through element and attributes in DOM.

xpath is representing an address of element
Location of element -- means address of element

DOM is nothing but the document object model
DOM is an API interface provided by browser
when webpage is loaded browser creates a Document Object Model of the page

while loading web page DOM view automatically created by the browser itself

DOM structure is generate as the page of loading 

xpath is basically a path

Full Xpath Example 

/html/body/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/img

Types of xpath 
1. Absolute xpath --is called as full xapth
/html/body/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/img

every node have to speciffy by using seperate slash /

1. Absolute xpath start from root node 
2. Absolute xpath  start with single /
3. Absolute xpath dont use any attribute only use node&tag 

2. Relative xpath --is called as partial xpath

//*[@id="app"]/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/img

1. Relative xpath directly jump to that element on DOM
2. Relative xpath start with double //
3. Relative xpath we use some attibutes and values 

syntax of relative xpath 

//tagname[@attribute='attribute value']
// *[@attribute='attribute value']
* represents the regular expression which are matching with all tag on DOM 

How to generate xpath of the element 
----------------------------
1.Right click on element --> Inspect--> Highlight Html--Right click--> copy xpath

2. Chropath Extension
3. selectorHub
chropath which is avilable on chrome as well as firefox browser
After adding chropath multiple options are available on web page to find the css selector and xpath 

After click on element automatically generate relative xpath 
After click on elemet all the locators display which are supported by the selenium

3. selectorHub 
How to install seletorsHub
2. Chropath Extension
3. selectorHub -- both are implemented by sanjay kumar 

question which xpath will be prepared & why ?

Absolute--
/html/body/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/img

there are 2 problems of absolute xpath/ Full xpath 
1.eg some of the time remove the middle one node -- unable to locate the element
2.some of the time change the location of middle node -- unable to locate the xpath 
3.some times after add new element and delete the existing element xpath will broke 
4.sometimes element remove and change the location in that case absolute xpath will be broken 

Relative-- 
//input[@id='username']
// means it is representing the entire DOM structure
wherever attribute is present that will directly jump to that element and will find that element

eventhough new node is added change the location of element-- no problem at all 
this is the main technical reason why we use to relative xpath. 

Xpath options 
this are differnt options we can use along with the xpath 
or 
and
contains()
start-with()
txt()
chained xpath 

in java (inside double quotation "  another "double quotation "") -- are not allowed 

some times dynamically change the elements 
property of element will be dynamically change in those cases we need to write the dyanamic xpath 

in that case we use this methods 
contains()
start-with()
txt()

Xpath with or operator 
//input[@id='username' or @iname='userName']
sometimes we can specify multiple attribute and values also 
either the 1st attribute should be there or 2nd atribute should be there 
one of them is matching then this will be able to locate the element

For ex 1st attribute and value is matching 2nd attribute and value is not matching still it will go and locate the element 

Or types means one of them should be match, at least one attribute should be match.
both are not match unable to locate the element 


Xpath with And operator 
//input[@id='username' And @iname='userName']

In this and operator both attribute should be match then it will locate the element
In all other cases element will not be able to locate
1st  attribute match & 2nd attribute not matched unable to locate the elements 

or and And both are case sensitive-- should not put upper case character 

Xpath with contains() method 

while elements attribute dynamically changes that time contains() method is very very imp.
//input[contains(@attribute, 'value')]
not need to pass the full value of attribute 

along with xpath also use contains method 

contains() method is which will verify the attribute value is a part of actual value then it will go to locate the element

This is called as dynamic xpah
dynamic xpath we can use static method 

start -- button
stop -- button 

//input[contains(@id,'st')]--Both button spelling st is same that  time use contains method it will locate the element on web page 
even start button it is able to match the locator 
even stop button it is able to match the locator 
this is called as dynamic xpath

Those properties are dynamically changed
//input[contains(@id,'st')]----dynamic xpath--in contains doesent matter st value where is present in that attribute values 
//input[start-with(@id,'st')]----dynamic xpath
In  start with method -- attribute value should be start with st
given value in start with type it should not be on different place 

How to locate the element by using text method 
text()
//a[text()='women']

Chained Xpath 
//form[@id='searchbox']//input[@id='search_top_query']

chained xpath means--we can write multiple xpath 
sometime one xpath unable to locate the element then we can chained another xpath 
It should write the 1st xpath of form tag name -- it is parent xpath  
and 2nd is inside the form with tagName  --- it is a child xpath 
//form[@id='women']//input[4] -- this is called as chained xpath  
[4] is a index number of TagName inside the parent xpath 

xpath of Access
Xpath access are those access that are used to search for the multiple nodes in the XML documents from the current node context

This methods are mainly used when the element is not identified with the help of id, name, class, link text, css selectors 

/html/body/table[1]/tbody/tr[3]/td[1]/div/div/ul/li[2]/a

Xpath method--"contains" it is very usefull to work with dynamic xpath 
Two types ofcontains xpath 
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'Values')]
//tagName[contains(text(), 'display')]
------------------------------------
Wait in slenium
Thread.sleep(milisecond)-- mention the milisecond here which will pass the code for sometimes rest of the code 
There is not a any balance between automation script and element on web page 
most of the time automation script is faster than the application response 

Implicit wait 
Explicit Wait
Fluent Wait 

1. Implicit wait
syntax of implicit waits 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(0, 10);
	
it is applicable for all on the web page it is a global wait 	
it is applicable for rest of the element throught the code 

Advantages
It is very easy to use 
add implicit waits only one 
which is applicable for all the elements 
maximum time out is 10 second

Dis 

1. import the webDriverManager 
2. import the chrome driver
3. WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();
---------------------------------------------------
2.Explicit Wait
Explicit Wait statement is a basically elemet specific we can wait for that element 
Additional specify some conditional also 

i will wait for that particular link or element on web page 

we have to add explicit wait multiple times 
it is not working for another element on web page 

syntax of explicit Wait 
WebDriverWait wait =new WebDriverWait(driver, 2);
 WebElement element= wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("//li[@ data-select2-id='select2-data-select2-axSelectProj-result-6y0p-qatestbed']")));
 element.click();
 
On web Page Eevery element we have to add the same condition of explicit wait  
we have to add explicit wait multiple time because this is a element specific

use the same condition for multiple elements 

ExpectedConditions is predefine class of selenium

How to write generic method for explixit wait

in this scenario it will create 3 parameters -- it will internally created 
same method we can call for multiple element

3.Fluent wiat --maximum timeout is 30 second
fluent wait is more similar to webdriver wait with more flexibility in polling time and ignoring exceptions

Waiting 30 seconds for an element to be present on the web page , checking
for its presence once every 5 seconds 

Declare the fluent wait before driver.get(" "); syntax//before launch the browser
sometimes application is very slow that time synchronization error facing then we will use the wait 


After giving correct locator exception ---> unable to locate element on web age
Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchFrameException: no such frame
  (Session info: chrome=116.0.5845.141) 
Ans --driver.switchTo().frame(1);

types of iframes in selenium 

Normally frames are used for horizontally vertically split of the screen
split the entire page into multiple sections.
iframe is differnt , they are basically insert a contains from another source 
iframes having the contains -it is comming from different source
cannot direclty interact with the element inside the iframes 

1. Diff between frame and iframe?
2. How to handle iframes in WEebDriver?
3. How to switch between multiple iframes ?
4. How to work with inner iFrames?

How to switch frame 
by using 
driver.switchTo().frame("name of the frame/id of the frame") it is not a attribute it is just pass a attribute value
driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement) entire frame as awebelement
driver.switchTo().frame(0) sometimes we can also pass the index - index start from 0


1st Frame 
driver.switchTo().frame("PackagList Frame")// name of the frame
driver.findElement(by.xpah(" ")).click() 
1st went to the 1st frame then perform the action on click();

Thread.sleep(2000);

2nd iframe
driver.switchTo().frame("PackagList Frame")// name of the frame
driver.findElement(by.xpah(" ")).click();
-switch to the 2nd frame perform the action on click

Thread.sleep(2000);
3rd iframe
driver.switchTo().frame("PackagList Frame")// name of the frame
driver.findElement(by.xpah(" ")).click();
-switch to the 3rd frame perform the action on click

1st frame depend on 2nd frame depend on 3rd frame 

Error :- Nosuch frame exception 
driver focus on 1st frame -- After performing the action we have to come out from that particular frame - then we need to switch to the second frame 

After action how to go back to the main frame 
driver.switchTo().frame("PackagList Frame")// name of the frame should be correct 
driver.findElement(by.xpah(" ")).click();
driver.switchTo().defaultContent();// it is go back to the main page 

then switch to the 2nd frame and perform the action in switch frame 
agian one more time go back to the main page 

After Applying every frame we can keep 
Thread.sleep(2000);

Inner frame how we can do that
1st go to outer iframe then switch to inner iframe 
outer iframe contains a inner iframe 
dont have a any attribute on that element  we can use the web element 
we can get this frame as a webelement 

inspect element--right click on element - copy the xpath
form/frame instide of iframe 
soemtimes form/frame this kind of tag they are refering the iframes 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tooltip message 
tooltip-- when user move the cursor over on text box and any link after display the text of that box name and link name 
tile attribute -- tooltip of that element.
tooltip is a value which is assign to the attribute value

How o capture the tooltip message

-----------------------------------
1 element multiple time on web page How to automate
After adding xpath we need to add index 
Index will start from 0
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//p[contains(text(),'Non Stop (38)')][1]")).click();

we should use this type of index with xpath //p[contains(text(),'Non Stop (38)')][1]

/html/body/div[1]/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div/div[1]/label/div/p
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drop down by jquery , combobox by jquery
in this scenario in drop down multiple options and multiple sub options 

Implicitwait added along with the driver

In this drop down we can select one options at a time or we can select multiple options at a tiem 
3 Tpes - select the 
single option
multiple option
all the option

generic method to pass the single valuues or multiple value by using this method 
selctchoiceValues(driver, "choice1")
we have to write one method

selctchoiceValues(driver, "choice1" "choice2", "choice3")  //select multiple option/values

selctchoiceValues(driver, "all")// we should abe to select all the values

Each selection we want to create seperate method // single, multiple, all

(WebDriver Driver, String...value)  - which can hold multiple values
This can hold all paramaeters single,multiple and all

String variable and 3 dot --it is used to hold all the values in jquery drop down 

inner loop will repeate multiple times 

Create a method in program

public static void selectChoiceValues(WebDriver Driver, String...value)

List<WebElemet> choiceList= driver.findElements(By.xpath)
if(!value[0].equalsIgnoreCase("all"))
{
for(webElement abc:choicelist)
{
String text= abc.gettext(); // it will show the all text of options 
}
}

Download the file 
DataBase testing using selenium--- We can check same scenario in selenium and firefox browser
How to downlaod the text  file and pdf file 

Three Actions we need to create 
1. enter the data
2. click on generate file button 
3. click on download button 
Entered text values in the text box it should be appear in down load files  
1. downlaod the text filed 

2. Download the pdf file 

1.In chrome browser no need to write the any additional commands
2.No need to add any additional steps

In fiefox browser 
It should do all the setting through automation 

before creating driver object and system.setProperty,  we should do additional settings for firfox browser
Only 2 classes required before creating driver object and set property

setPreference("abc","amitvalue") method will take the two parameter values 
1st abc is a key    // abc is a parameter this parameter passing  the values here "amitvalue"
2nd amitvalue  is a value

This is called as Mime type
Mime type--means what kind of file we need to download through firefox browser 

similaraly every kind of file it is a Mime type
mime type it is called as file extentions 

This steps are very important to download the file from firefox browser

FirefoxProfile profile= new FirefoxProfile();
	profile.setPreference("browser.helperApps.neverask", " text/plain,application/pdf");  // Mime type
	profile.setPreference("Browser.download.manager.ShowWhenStarting", false);
	profile.setPreference("pdfjs.disable", false);  //only for pdf

FirefoxOptions option= new FirefoxOptions();
	option.setProfile(profile);  //we need to add only profile
	System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver","C:\\Users\\JYOTHSNA\\eclipse-workspace\\seleniumBasicTest\\Drivers\\chromedriver.exe");
	WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(option);

Screen shot Automation
1. Full page ?
-Take screenshot interface which contain a method called get screenshots 
By using this  TakeScreenshot methos we can capture the full Pagee screenshot

2. Section of page  ?

3.Element on Page ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For  modification of grid values purpose 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For firefox browser -- No need  to change anything 

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","F:\\Selenium All programs 1\\Driver File\\Driver File\\chromedriver-win64\\chromedriver.exe");
WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();---
driver.get("https://demo.guru99.com/test/newtours/");

1.drive object-- will drive the entire exeution of program
Webdriver driver = new firefoxDrive  -- This step is called a template for each and every selenium program execution

Insteead of chormedriver we need to use firefox class
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data driven framework

We will preapre test data in Exel file and we read the data from Excel file and we used in automation testing and we will pass the same data in appliation 
Data driven -- data driven testing---> testing is driven by the data

By defoult selenium doesn't support by Excel file or microsoft Exel
other than selenium doesn't support to  any other funtional, expect web element action and locator

For support we can integrate 3rd party API or libarry 

For Excel  Microsoft excel doesn't support by selenium---For this we need to use third party library which is called Apachi P library

Name- Apachi POI library   or We can say API
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd video

data driven test case which contains a 2 parts 
1st is the applicaion code---> we have to interact with the elements, launch the browser, validations are commes under  in application code

2nd excel related code --> find the  number of rows, number of columns reading and writting the data in Excel sheet

For every test cases --> we have to create excel related operations
1st  we need to write the piece of code for application side 
2nd we need to write a piece of code  for Excel side 

Major problem--> testcase become complex along with  application and excel side code

2nd problem--> Excel related code is repeating for evry test case--- Duplication 

Commun operation for excel filewe need to create One forlder Utility files --- Folde name  we can give anything.

Every data driven test cases no need to write the Excel releated code , just we need to write the Application related code

Utility file 
Advantages 
2. no need to write the excel code in every test case, so complexity of code is reduce
2.Reusability we achive --> no need to write the code for every test cases,  
we will call this method in every code/Testcase

All common methods are store in this class thats why it is called as utility file --  Utility file -it is always a reusability file.


How to create a data driver test cases
Understand the fucntionality of tes cases
1. Functionality (Test Case)
2. Preapre test data in Excel 
3. Develope Automation Script.

In data Driven testing framework
We can take valid data and invalid data
We can execute the same test case with multiple set of data
When i give positive data -- test case will be pass
When i give  Negative data -- Testcase will be faile

1st  step 
We need to deal with application and we need to deal with Excel file 

gettext method we have to use because  the this is a inner text 
Before execute Testcase we have to close the Excel file

if  Excel file is already open --> Still it will work but the problem is excel file will be lock our automation 
Automation is lock the excelfile at run time thats why user unable to update the data in excel file

In Automation After release Excel file we cannot do anything
-- that is the reason we have the cloe the Excel file at a time of running
Excel File is open-- sometime it will not  work proper, it will not release automatically
After execution we can open 

Without loop we can not repeate the step in data driven framework.
Without loop we can not repeate the step in data driven framework.

Similaraly we keep the data in the Properies File

Reading Properties file
Properties file just like a text file 

Config.file create in testdata folder
We have to add some data in config file 
Some common data which are require for automation , browser, caes
common data which require for multipe test cases we will maintain in the properties file

How we can read the data from config properties file through automation screen 
---------------------------------------------------------
Action class in Selenium
un/pwd -amit555/Amit@#123

Action act =new Action(driver)

act.MoveToElement(name).MoveToElement(blog).click().build().perform()

Click() --method also belongs to Actions class

-------------------------------
Keyboard action in selenium

WE can handle the slider  by using Keyboard action

On ly source is there target  is not available i have  to drag from source to target

How to handle the  slider element using Keyboard actions

Withotu target also we can do the drag and drop 
Main purpose of slider--->Move the elemeent on x and y axis according to change the values on X and Y axis 

Vertical slider--> move on the Y axis ---> X axis is constant
Horizontal slider--> Move on the X axis--> Y axis is constant

Location of element -- means X and Y axis cooordiate value we have to capture

1 slider
dragAndDropBy(Element, x, y)
Using action class we can handle the Slider

Keyboard action --->
We can handle Keybord action using Action class 
Shortcut keys purpose we can use Keyboard actions


Use Send key to enter the Text
Control A
Control C 
Click on Tab
Control V

Bot method we have to execute combine
KeyDown(key.control)--> is used to press the key
KeyUp(key.control)--> is used to release the key


ex. CTRL + Sift+A
act.keyDown(Keys.CONTROL).keyDown(Keys.SHIFT).sendkeys("A").KeyUp(Keys.SHIFT).KeyUp(Keys.SHIFT).KeyUp(Keys.Control).perform();

Ex. Enter
act.keyDown(Keys.ENTER).keyDown(Keys.ENTER).perform();
-----------------------------
After click on register  button  ---> Home page is gone 
But i dont want to gone Home Page 

Its possible only through keyboard actions

Click methods will available in 2 places WebElement and Action class

Webelement --> click method doesnt accept the parameter
Actions --> Click method accept the parameter 

After expire session -- unable to locate the element

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Jenkins framework in Selenium

First we will go with Run service as local System(not recomended)

Select the port 
Click on test connection.    
Execute this Command in command prompt 
netstat -ano | findstr :8080
then click on Next 
Add the java Home Path 

netstat -ano | findstr :8080
GO  to services window 
right click on jenkins --> Properies--> click on log on 
Username/Pwd- Automation/Amit@555

Go to Jenkins folder and open password in notpad
---->Administrator password<----
37a38455fa434dfc8a86d2d5b2c55406

After enter password --
Click on Install the pluggins---> By default all plugins are installed 

Then create First Admin user
user/password- amit777/amit@123

Data Base  Automation test cases 

	




























--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Browser Commnads 
navigate().to()
navigate().back()
navigate().forward()
navigate().refresh()

What is the diff get  and navigate().to() commnad

fucntionality wise no differnce

get method -- it will take url only in string format

navigate is another method     and to() is a actual method
navigate().to()-- this is also callling the internal get method-- 
in this method we can pass url as a string or we can pass  URL in the form of objects 
We can call the 2 methods internally

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automation frame work? 

We can organize automation project files/folders in structured manner

Why we need  to go for framework
-->Obejctive
1.Re-usability ---we should avoid the duplicaion -- we can use the same code

2.Maintainability--- We can add the new test cases in existing frame work- we can modify the existing test caes without impacting other test cases and 
without impacting any other files, it should be  maintain a long period of time , we can add the new  test cases, 
remove the existing test cases that is all about maintainability

3.Readability-- Everyone should able to understand a code, any other user should able to add new test cases and should able to modify existing test cases 

Types of framework
1.Built in 
  EX TestNG, junit, Cucumber, robot etc...
  
2. Customized (user defined)
Modular framework, dat driven, keywork driven, Hybrid driven etc..  

Phases/stages 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Analysing Automate
-Number of Pages 
-What are all elements/ how/ type
-What to automate /what we cannot automate -- Foar application  what are things we can automate and what are the things we cannot automate
that we need to identify 
Because everything we can not automate some of the things we need to do manual 

Automation we can not achieve 100%

2).Choose test caes for automate 

Initial build we cant do automation testing ----> because initial time build is not stable 
If build is not stable we can't start the automtion testing 
First few round of testing we have to manual testing 

What is the criteria of automation testing 

what is the meaning of 100 % automation--->

100 test cases ---> 90 test cases are automated, and 10 test cases can not automate   ---> this is called 100% automation 

If 50 test cases automated ----> This is called 100% automation
100% automation is possible in one context
if  your expecting entire application should be automated  if you are considering 100% automation -no thats nevver possible 

2).How to  choose  the test cases for automation 

Based on the priority we have to choose the test cases for automation 

Eg. In 100 Test cases 

1) sanity test cases --->P1----->means basic functionality test cases-- if this test cases are fail we can not proceed further execution
   IF you execute rest of the test cases (retest, rgression, other test cases)- sanity test cases should be passed 
2) Data driven test cases /re-test--P2--- this is a repetation we must automate --we cannot miss to automate
3) Regression test cases- P3---> Regression test we need to automate --- we have prefer 100% automation testing 
4) Any other test cases -P4 

Whwn developer give multiple bug fixes at the time we can identify the regression testcases
Rgression Testing defination ---> during regression testing we will identify the impacted area accordingly 
what are the test cases covering this area we will pick those test cases and automate this test cases. 

3).Design and Development of framework 

Design--creating a framework and folder structure is called design 
Most of the time senior people will design by the  framwwork  4to 5 + years of experiance  person will design 
design and development  
design is totallly difference 
Contribution  towards the framework with developer  this is also difference , i have involving the design buti am not done the entire design myself. 
i am taking the help of other team member.

4) Execution 
Execution can be happen in different level

Two kinds of Excution--> local, remotly

Local -- my code is avialble in eclips 
Remote-- I push the code from other repository
I will execute my test in some other place and some other machine.

jenkins pull the code from the git repository and execute in the  remote machine..

5) Maintenance 

E-commerce domain
------------------------------------
1.Frontent Operations  (customers/users)
- register an account
- login 
- Search for the  product 
- add/edit/delet product from cart
- order products
- reviews
etc.

2.Backend operation (admins/backend teams)
-Products 
-customers
-orders
-Store
etc.
-----------------------------------------------------
Create a one maven project 

Page object class -- 
1. Locator
2.Constructor---Constructor name should be same as the class name
3.Action class

Base page class 
Only constructor  - No need to create anything

Base class is the parent of all the page object classes

All pagge object classes should be drive frome base class
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Building framework from scrach 

src/main/java
In this  folder we have to create a base class

Step1 . create 1 data.property file/folder -- in that folder we need to add browse details and location

Base class is the invoking the chrome driver 

src/test/java---In test folder only test cases should go 

From base class 
chome browser setproperty is not running thats why  nullpointer Exception error message getting

Verify whether script is going or not inside the If block
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If change  the browwsser name in Data properties file --- data properties file madhe je browser ch name aahe tya browser madhe all test cases will be execute 
depend on condition of base class
Then all test cases will be run in the firefox browser.

If wrong path - Agian it will show the Nullpointer Expection error--- we need to check If else condtion statement and then
Then check that statement will go or not in If syntax

2nd error
FAILED: basepageNavigation
java.io.FileNotFoundException:
--> We need to check some file is missing 

3rd FAILED: basepageNavigation
java.io.FileNotFoundException: E:\Slenium 2024-03\E2EFramework\src\main\java\MavenFrame\data.properties (The system cannot find the file specified)
	at java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.open0(Native Method)
Ans--> change data properties file location  thats why  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Page Object Module  ---

Easy to maintain 
Easy Readability of scripts 
Reduce and eliminate duplicacy
Reusability of code
Reliability 

WHy use PageObjectmodule -lot of compatibility in selenium thats why POM is used
it is a very good pattern to design a framework

Page object moduel is same  for selenium web automation and  and Appium mobile automation 
All basic concept is same for mobile and web automation testing

rediiff. comm 
All the objects belongs to home page i will write in home page class 

After click on sign in page --- it will navigate to sign in page 

For login Page - i will create login classs 
In this classs --- i will create all the  object  for login page
For each page i will create a seperate class -- for eg 5 page  -- i will create a 5 closs

Object belonging to that page i will write in class by naming as className

Write test cases 
For eg i have 1000 test cases   i will call the  from login class because all the objects belongs from login class
 
I will call the object from login page to Test case class

For exmp any chnage in login page i wil update the change in login class after that my all test cases are execute successfuly

Only one update is getting reflected to all the test cases

We need to update only that page class 
for evry page we have to create the class

Only constructor class is common for all the class in page object module

We can use two page object classes and execute this 2 page object classes in one test class

Erorr 
Nullpointer Exception  -- After getting this error 

loginpage log = new loginpage(this.driver);

We have to call cunstructor  by using this keyword

Error- file not found means -- we have to check exact file location
We need to update correct filePath

Interview  Question on Selenium in Framework
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page object factory -- it is a more simple of page object module

Only difference occures writting the Page object classes

If in my projeect 6 page is open i will creat the 6 class  

------------------------------------------------
